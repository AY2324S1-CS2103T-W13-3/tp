## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `transact.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Tran$act.

4. Double click `transact.jar` to start the app. The GUI below should appear in a few seconds.

> **❗If the above does not work, try this method:**
>
> Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, type `java -jar transact.jar` and press Enter to run the application.<br>

5. The app contains some sample data. Type `view s` to switch to the _staff list_.

> Alternatively, you can click on the Staff List/Transaction tab at the top of the window to switch to the staff/transaction
> view respectively.

6. Let's add a new staff member: type `addstaff n/Isaac p/92345678 e/isaac@gmail.com a/Blk 456, Pasir Ris St 32 t/marketing` and press Enter.

   This creates a new staff member called `Isaac` with the phone number `92345678`, email `isaac@gmail.com`, address `Blk 456, Pasir Ris St 32`, and adds an optional tag with the name `marketing`.

7. Let's add a new transaction: type `add ty/E d/Flyer printing amt/100 on/23/10/23 s/7` and press Enter.

   This creates a new transaction with type `E` for expense, description `Flyer printing`, amount `100`, date `23/10/2023` and staff with ID of `7`, which in this case is `Isaac` from the previous step since that's what the app automatically assigned them.

   Notice that the app automatically switches to the _transaction list_, and your newly added transaction appears at the bottom of the list.

8. Congratulations, you have successfully added a staff member and a transaction!

9. Once you have familarized yourself with Tran$act and want to begin inputting your own data, feel free to type `clearstaff` and press Enter followed by `cleartransaction` and press Enter to clear the transaction book and staff list.

10. Now, you can begin using Tran$act for to record your own data.
