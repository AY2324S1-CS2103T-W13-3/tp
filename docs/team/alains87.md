### Project: Tran$act

Tran$act - The transaction recorder is a powerful software tool tailored to meet the needs of accountants and proficient typists who prefer command-line interfaces. With its efficient design, users can swiftly add, remove, view, edit, and even recover deleted transactions. The software provides a user-friendly dashboard offering a concise snapshot of the company's financial status, including total income, expenses, and monthly net profit, making it a valuable asset for financial analysis and decision-making. Users can also identify cost allocation by sector, aiding in cost-efficiency enhancements. Additionally, the software offers robust financial reporting capabilities, allowing users to generate customizable reports in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats for seamless data sharing with stakeholders. To ensure data security and reliability, the software features encryption and automated backup options. An integrated address book simplifies contact management, making this software an indispensable tool for anyone seeking efficient financial data management.
